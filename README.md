## Project Overview
**The GreenLife Urban Agriculture Management System** enables GreenLife to efficiently track farm locations, crop details, volunteer and employee data, harvest records, and resource inventory. 
The database supports decision-making and operations, ensuring each farm has the necessary resources and workforce to maintain crop health and distribute produce effectivelly.

**Entities and Attributes**
## 1. Farm Locations
### Purpose: Stores details about each farm location.
**Attributes:**
- Location_ID (Primary Key): Unique ID for each farm location.
- Address: Address of the farm.
- Type: Type of space (e.g., rooftop, garden).
- Size: Farm size in square meters.
- Sunlight_Availability: Hours of sunlight per day.
- Water_Source: Availability of water.

## 2. Crops
### Purpose: Contains details of crops grown at each farm.
**Attributes:**
- Crop_ID (Primary Key): Unique ID for each crop.
- Farm_ID (Foreign Key): Links to the associated farm location.
- Crop_Type: Type of crop (e.g., tomatoes, lettuce).
- Planting_Date: Date the crop was planted.
- Expected_Harvest_Date: Expected date for harvest.
- Care_Requirements: Specific care needs for each crop.

## 3. Workforce
### Purpose: Stores information on workers, both volunteers and employees.
**Attributes:**
- Worker_ID (Primary Key): Unique ID for each worker.
- Name: Workerâ€™s name.
- Role: Position or role (e.g., volunteer, employee).
- Tasks_Assigned: Tasks the worker is assigned to.
- Hours_Worked: Total hours worked.
- Special_Skills: Relevant skills (e.g., planting, maintenance).

## 4. Harvest Records
### Purpose: Tracks harvest details, including amounts and distribution.
**Attributes:**
- Harvest_ID (Primary Key): Unique ID for each harvest record.
- Crop_ID (Foreign Key): Links to the crop being harvested.
- Farm_ID (Foreign Key): Links to the farm location of the crop.
- Harvest_Date: Date of harvest.
- Quantity: Amount of produce harvested.

## 5. Inventory and Resources
### Purpose: Manages supplies needed for farming.
**Attributes:**
- Item_ID (Primary Key): Unique ID for each item.
- Item_Name: Name of the inventory item.
- Quantity: Current stock level.
- Cost: Cost per unit of the item.
- Supplier_Info: Information about the item supplier.

## Relationships Between Entities

- A Farm Location can grow multiple Crops.
- Each Crop is associated with a single Farm Location.
- Workers can be assigned to multiple farms and various tasks.
- Each Harvest Record links to a specific Crop and Farm Location.
- Inventory supports multiple farms by supplying necessary resources.

## Keys and Constraints

- Primary Keys: Unique identifiers for each entity, such as Location_ID in Farm Locations and Crop_ID in Crops.
- Foreign Keys: Establish relationships between tables (e.g., Farm_ID in Crops links to Location_ID in Farm Locations).
- Constraints:
  - NOT NULL: Ensures essential fields are always filled.
  - UNIQUE: Ensures fields like Worker_ID have unique values.

--CONCLUSION
The GreenLife Urban Agriculture Management System helps manage city farms by keeping track of farm locations, crops, workers, and supplies. This system makes it easier to grow fresh food in cities, use resources wisely, and support the community. By organizing farm data and processes, GreenLife can make better decisions, run farms smoothly, and create greener, healthier urban spaces for everyone.
